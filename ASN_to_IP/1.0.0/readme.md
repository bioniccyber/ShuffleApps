# ASN to IP
This app performs Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) lookups for a list of IP addresses. ASN lookups can be used by blue teams to determine the provenance and, in some cases, the legitimacy of IPs and domains. For this reason, Team Cymru maintains a list of ASN to IP mappings based on BGP feeds from 50+ BGP peers, updated at 4 hour intervals.

## App Usage
The app expects as input the list of IPs you want to look up. As noted/recommended by the Team Cymru Documentation, the list should be at most a few thousand in order to minimize overall load.
